Most of it was troubleshooting and encountering problems with our USART communication so there wasn't a lot of specifc progress. The primary work I did this week was troubleshooting the STM32. From last week, we had some parts of the project working but overall very little was entirely functional. We encountered problems with our USART communications whenever we tried to run the code in "run" mode instead of debug mode. OUr theory was that the STM clock was driven by USB or some part of the debugger when in run mode and that when it ran in "run" mode, the clock was configured differently. I suspected that our clock configuration was bad, so we spent a long time looking at the diagrams from the manuals for our board. The two clock configuration diagrams are shown below. `),e("p",null,null,-1),e("img",{style:{"max-width":"100%"},src:h},null,-1),e("h3",null,"Figure 1: The clock structure in the STM32F091xx device",-1),e("img",{style:{"max-width":"100%"},src:u},null,-1),e("h3",null,"Figure 2: The clock architecture in STM32FO devices",-1),t(" Careful study of these diagrams led me to the conclusion that we were configuring the PLL clock source correctly for our device. We were updating the PLLSRC, PLLMUL, and SW bits in the RCC->CFGR register. And based on our PWM signal, the PCLK signal coming out of our AHB scaler was correct. The USART modules used either the HCLK or PCLK signals to function but both of the signals seemed configured for 48 MHz. As such we were left baffled as to the random functioning of our USART communication. For 2 days (~6-8 hours each), we troubleshooted everything we could think of. I wrote code to slow down our USART responses, to wait between each transaction, to verify that every character was being sent. In debug mode the code worked perfectly, but every time we would go to run the code, it would just hang. What made it even harder to debug was that it would hang a different places. Sometimes USART would never start, sometimes it would get to the 3rd command in the configuration sequence before hanging. We never managed to figure this out. What Luke ultimately did that fixed it was change our code to use the native 8MHz HSI clock. After this change, our results were consistent and we were able to correctly diagnose the other problems. "),e("br",null,null,-1),e("br",null,null,-1),t(" Zack and I worked on finalizing the code after Luke figured out that change. I wrote code that verified that we could send a character properly over USART. Once we had established that, we were able to determine that the Wi-Fi module needed more time before we send the first command. Our code was hanging because we sent a command and waited for a response before the wifi module ever had a chance to see the message. This caused our program to hang before it ever configured the wifi module. As such, we changed our code to just wait for a long time (100000 cycles) before it tried to configure WiFi. This fixed the problem and also fixed another problem we were having where the code would run but then if we power cycled the device it would no longer run. We realized this is because the Wifi module was still not having enough time to boot and so when we power cycled, it would reset but when we just reran the code, the wifi module would stay on and therefore work as intended. But with this new delay code, everything runs fine. And by the end of the day we were able to successfully send random data to two modules simultaneously which was part of our PSSC's.

I rolled all our bluetooth and wifi ESP32 code into a cohesive module so in theory, as soon as the app is able to connect to the ESP32, we will be back to the place we were at before with our project except now it will be with our final app. Much of the work I did today had to do with data structures in python. The ble.gatts_register_services function takes a very specific form of service data structure. The function expectes a tuple composed of two more tuples, each of which is itself another tuple.

We had to go deep in the clock mechanism block diagrams to figure out how to use the inbuilt clocking features. I spent some time figuring out exactly how the block diagram works. To configure the clocking mechanism, we needed to set some different registers. I set the value of the PLLSRC register to 0x10 to select the HSI 8Mhz input. The diagram included reference to an internal HSI48 clock line that would have been 48 MHz as we wanted, but it was not actually available on our hardware. Thus we selected the HSI line. Then I needed to configure the PREDIV bits to perform no division on the signal. Then I configured PLLMUL to multiply by 8 to get a 48MHz signal. Finally, we configure the SW switch to select the PLLCLK line as the input clock to the system. After configuring all these registers, we finally got the clock to work correctly for our PWM signal.

Our wifi module will send the OK response but the STM32 never detects it and so it just hangs forever.

First, a front plate that hosts the LED grid between a plastic layer and a layer of clear acrylic covering. Second, a side layer that spans the z-axis for our device. And third, a back cover that serves to complete the enclosure and what our PCB is actually mounted to. In the work I did this week, I started with the side casing that hosts the power socket.In a bit of a rushed decision, I decided to mount our power socket in the wall of our case without checking the z-axis. I drilled a hole of the right size to fit the wall plug and then used the glue gun to mount it more permanently. Fortunately, as I found out later, the location I chose for the wall plug works fine for the design, but it would have been smart to double check before I just went ahead and drilled the hole.

I didn't break the soldering but it is not the most ideal configuration. Once I had the LED grid in the right place, I used hot glue to mount it to 3D printed part.

The first challenge was with timing. The first thing we did was revisit some code from ECE 362 to configure timers on the STM32. That was a very useful resource. From this starting point, we got the STM32 dev board working with TIM1. At this point, our goal was to configure PWM. This proved rather simple based on the configuration we took from the ECE362 code. Based on the data sheet of the WS2812b chip, a signal of 0.4uS high followed by 0.85uS high represents a 0 and a signal of 0.8uS high followed by 0.45uS low represents a 1. To enable this timing with the STM32, we set the TIM1->ARR register to 60 (technically 59 because the MC adds 1). Using this value, the 64% duty cycle for a 1 corresponds to a 38, and the 32% duty cycle of a 0 corresponds to a 19. In our C code I added these values for easy reference. With this functionality in place we started driving the output pin.

The challenge we had to overcome was ultimately a misunderstanding of how the WS2812's work. In effect, we wrote data that we thought should vary the color of the LED's to the pin that they were connected to. However, we basically just got a constant color output from the lights. The problem was that the lights wait for a low signal to actually set their values. We managed to send a repeating pattern of 1s and 0s but we never sent the stop condition that would let the LED's write their data. As such we were significantly slowed down. Eventually however, we did successfully send data to the strip. We configured an interrupt to update what array we read from each time it fires. That allowed us to do basic color switching along a strip.

However, the main advantage over more general LED strips is the reduced pin count. Using non-addressable LED's would require at least 2n pins for an nxn grid.
